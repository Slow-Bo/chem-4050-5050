    "\n",
    "## Learning Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this lecture, you should be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Identify reaction orders and rate laws** based on experimental data and understand their significance in chemical kinetics.\n",
    "2. **Perform linear regression analysis** to determine reaction rate constants using Python and NumPy.\n",
    "3. **Use integrated rate laws** to linearize reaction data and apply regression techniques to find rate constants.\n",
    "4. **Visualize and interpret reaction kinetics** by plotting concentration vs. time and log-concentration vs. time graphs.\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that in Lecture 4 we determined how to use numerical methods to compute the equilibrium progress of a chemical reaction. This prediction corresponded to the final state of the reaction, but we did not consider the rate at which the reaction reached equilibrium. In this lecture, we will discuss how to determine the rate constant of a reaction using linear regression analysis.\n",

    "### A Refresher or Primer on Rate Laws\n",
    "\n",
    "The rate of a chemical reaction is the rate at which the reactants are consumed and the products are formed. It is described by a \"rate law,\" which is an equation that relates the rate of a reaction to the concentration of the various chemical species present at time $t$. Rate laws are determined experimentally and cannot, in general, be derived from the stoichiometry of the reaction. Rate laws are typically expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{rate} = k[A]^m[B]^n\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $k$ is the \"rate constant,\" $m$ and $n$ are the \"orders of the reaction\" with respect to reactants $A$ and $B$, respectively, and $[A]$ and $[B]$ are the concentrations of reactants $A$ and $B$, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Orders of Reaction\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"order of reaction\" with respect to a reactant is the power to which the concentration of that reactant is raised in the rate law. The overall order of the reaction is the sum of the orders of the reaction with respect to each reactant. The order of reaction is determined experimentally and is not related to the stoichiometry of the reaction.\n",

    "Imagine that your lab has purchased a container of 1.24 M N$_2$O$_5$(g).

When you returned to the lab, you found that the N$_2$O$_5$(g) had decomposed. Realizing the importance of the decomposition kinetics of N$_2$O$_5$(g) on the experiment you were planning, you suggested to your PI that you could determine the rate constant of the decomposition reaction. Your PI agreed and asked you to determine the rate constant of the decomposition of N$_2$O$_5$(g) at 318 K. You collected the following data:\n",
