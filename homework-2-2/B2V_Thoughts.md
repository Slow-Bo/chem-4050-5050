## Why temperature dosn't seem to effect some B2Vs
It appears as though temperature does not have a large effect on B2V if using either the Hard Shell Potential or the Square Well Potential to calculate. They do differ slightly from eachother, but neither seems too interested in changing with temperature. This is because temperature straight up dosn't matter for Hard Shell potential, since it is either one of the quotents of 0 or infinity. For Square Well Potential it does matter slightly since in the square well it is being used to divide the exponent -0.01. As temperature increases, this number is pushed more toward -0 making it resemble the Hard Shell potential even more.

## When temperature matters
Temperature *does* matter for B2V when calculating with the Lennard Jones Potential. This is because Lennard Jones is a much more sophisticated calculation that always outputs a non-zero and non infinity number. This means it is capable of showing the trend of B2V getting less negitive as temperature increases. Using Lennard Jones potential also results in numbers far lower in orders of magnitude than the other two potentials. This is likely because it doesn't get automatically set to infinity after crossing a certain threshold.
