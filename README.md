# chem-4050-5050
This repository is a collection of the Homework assignments prepared for Chem 4050-5050 in Fall of 2025

## Data
Contains data that is to be used by multiple homework assignments!

## homework-1
Contains the first homework of the semester. Includes clalculations of data from a CSV document and the calculations of the hamiltonian from the time independant schrodinger equation

## homework-2
Contains the second homework of the semester. Includes optimization algorythoms for argon dimers and trimers, the results of said optimization, and the calculation of the time independant schrodinger equation.

## homework-3
Contains the third homework of the semester. Includes programs to calculate troutons rule, programs to optimize the energy produced by troutons rule, and the data used in, and calculated from troutons rule and its optimizations.

## homework-4
Contains the fourth homework of the semester. Includes programs to calculate thermodynamic work in a gas system and the data to go with it, thermodynamics of cesium, and the relationship between CV and U for an array of metal molecules.

## homework-5
Contains the fifth homework of the semester. Includes programs that utilize the monty carlo algorythom to calculate the overlap of two hydrogen atoms as well as kenetics of the laplacian.

## Project 1 Monty Carlo
Contains the project based around the monty carlo algorythom. Uses Monty Carlo and Metropolis to create a grand cannonical of a grid of nitrogen and hydrogen gas adsorption. Also has a PDF containing data resulting from that simulation.

## Project 1 Molecular Dynamics
Contains the project based around the molecualr dym=namics. Uses the Metropolis algorythom to optimize a polymer chain, and then verlet algorythom and anderson thermostat to simulate how that chain would act in space. Also has a PDF containing data resulting from that simulation.
