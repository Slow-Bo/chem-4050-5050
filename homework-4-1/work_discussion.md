# Thoughts on Work
# What happened?
Since work was negitive this means that the gas was doing work instead of having work done to it. This makes sence because preasure naturally wants to decrease, which it did as volume increases, meaning that work has to be done to the gas to get pressure to increase. 
# Why are the results the way they were?
The gas does more work isothermicly than it does adiabaticly. As volume increase, this differnce becomes more and more dramatic. The reason for this is the alternate definintion of work. Work done ON a system does equal the negitive integral of pressure with respect to volume, but work done BY a system is equal to Change in heat minus change in internal energy of the system. 

For an adibatic system this means that work is equal to the negative change in the internal energy of the system. Since the system is the one doing the work it's losing internal energy.

But in order to maintian it's temperature heat is added to the system in an isothermal situation. This means that change in heat is positive and change in energy is negitive. A positive minus a negitive is a larger positive meaning more work is done BY the isothermal system, and therefor the work done ON the system is more negative for isothermal.
